Tutorials and exercises of the book Head First Design Patterns.

----------------
Principles:

- Encapsulate what varies
- Favor composition over inheritance
- Program to interfaces, not implementations
- Strive for loosely couples designs between objects that interact
- Classes should be open for extension, but closes for modification

----------------

Chapter1: Strategy Pattern
- Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable.
- Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently of clients that use it

Chapter2: Observer Pattern

- Defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state,
  all it's dependents are notified and updated automatically

Chapter3: Decorator Pattern

- Attach additional responsibilities to an object dynamically.
- Decorators provide a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality
